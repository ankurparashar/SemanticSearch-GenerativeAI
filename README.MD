# SematicSearch-GenerativeAI
This project focuses on building a generative search system in the fashion domain. Inspired by the approach demonstrated in the "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)" session, the goal is to design a system that can effectively and accurately answer questions derived from a Myntra dataset.

# Problem Statment
Finding the right product online often feels harder than it should be — users know what they want, but search engines don’t always understand what they mean. Our solution bridges that gap by interpreting natural language queries, grasping user intent, and delivering context-aware product recommendations that feel genuinely personalized. Instead of just matching words, it understands meaning, relevance, and reasoning behind every suggestion.
