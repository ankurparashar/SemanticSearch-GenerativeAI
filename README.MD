# SematicSearch-GenerativeAI
This project focuses on building a generative search system in the fashion domain. Inspired by the approach demonstrated in the "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)" session, the goal is to design a system that can effectively and accurately answer questions derived from a Myntra dataset.

# Problem Statment
Finding the right product online often feels harder than it should be ‚Äî users know what they want, but search engines don‚Äôt always understand what they mean. Our solution bridges that gap by interpreting natural language queries, grasping user intent, and delivering context-aware product recommendations that feel genuinely personalized. Instead of just matching words, it understands meaning, relevance, and reasoning behind every suggestion.
